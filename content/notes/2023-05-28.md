### Editor for Nuxt Content

When I learned about [NuxtContent](https://content.nuxtjs.org/), I started to wonder what would be the best MD editor for my notes and articles. Googling `nuxt content md editor` did not provide any good answers.

That's when I decided to test GitHub's code editor to add and edit notes. It has everything I need - authorization (via GitHub), web interface, version control and previews. I decided to give it a go.

It turns out, it works great and this note was already with GitHub's editor.
