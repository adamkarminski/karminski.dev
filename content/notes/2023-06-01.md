### Cognitive overload

It's a strange feeling when you suddenly realise that you have to handle more things that you can mentally process. For me, it happened kind of suddenly. I guess I just didn't realize that I'm actually reeeally close to my limit. A few new things on a plate, and suddenly you feel more exhausted at an exponential rate.
