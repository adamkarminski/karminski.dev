### If something may go wrong, it will

Experience may help you recognize such situations before they happen. My experience is LucidChart migration, done in our department. I knew it was going to happen. I could've predicted that something MAY go wrong, since we created a new account. And, naturally, it did. Our integration got broken and we need to fix it ASAP. We could've avoided it if I asked myself - is there ANY chance, that there'll be some technological consequences. Lesson learnt.
